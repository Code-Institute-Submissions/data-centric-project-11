# THE COMMUNITY KITCHEN
### Data Centric Project 3
The Community Kitchen is intended to provide __*FREE*__ recipes by anyone who signs up with the website. It is a place to share all types of recipes with people around the world. People can create a profile, as well as create, read, update, and delete their recipes whenever they'd like.

## UX
### User Stories
* As a user, I want to learn new recipes as well as share my own for people to use.
* As a user who has signed up to this website, I want to be able to view other member's recipes and share my own.
### Strategy
My intention is to create a platform for all types of chef's to share their recipes
### SCOPE
I want to create a database of free recipes in one centralized website. User profiles, user recipes, user direct messages if they would like help for that recipe.
### STRUCTURE
The most important pages of the website are the homepage and recipe page. The homepage should provide information on what the website is and have a direct link to the other important page, the recipe page. The recipe page will contain all recipes added by the users to share.
